# cpplint - static code checker for C++

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tkruse/cpplint.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tkruse/cpplint)

This repository is a fork of the code hosted by google employees at
https://github.com/google/styleguide (was http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpplint).

This repository provides cpplint as a pypi package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cpplint).

The goal of this fork is to include contributions to cpplint from various authors, since google currently does not show any interest in modifications to cpplint.
This fork should attempt to remain backwards-compatible to the google cpplint fork in the output (except for fixing bugs), and also keep the changes to the codebase minimal to allow easy merges between both codebases.

It is possible that this repo lags behind the google repo, if you notice this, feel free to open an issue asking for an update.

To install from pypi:

```
$ pip install cpplint
```

The run by calling
```
$ cpplint [OPTIONS] files
```

For more information, see [Original README](README)
