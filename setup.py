guide (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml). As it
heavily relies on regular expressions, cpplint.py won't catch all violations of
the style guide and will very occasionally report a false positive. There is a
list of things we currently don't handle very well at the top of cpplint.py,
and we welcome patches to improve it.
